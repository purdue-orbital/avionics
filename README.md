Flight Computer Repository
==========================

This is the GitHub repository for all software pertaining to Purdue Orbital's *Hapsis Project* flight computer. Programs are coded in Python for use on a Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+.


## Getting Started ##

### 1. Connecting to the Raspberry Pi ###

Currently, there are two flight computers -- both RPi Model 3 B+. Connection can either be local, or over `PAL3.0` using ethernet. 

**NOTE: Currently, WiFi is not configured for these Pis, so they must be connected to `PAL3.0` over ethernet.**

To connect through SSH, PuTTY can be used (Windows) or the terminal (MacOS). Windows users can also use the command prompt. On the Pi, type `ifconfig | grep 'inet '`. The output should look something like:

`$ ifconfig | grep 'inet '`  

        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet 10.186.110.99  netmask 255.255.240.0  broadcast 10.186.111.255
        
The Pi's local IP address for `PAL3.0` is preceded by `inet`, and on the same line as `broadcast`. In this example, it is `10.186.110.99`.

Alternatively, if you have Bonjour installed, the rocket computer's IP should be `rocketcontroller.local` and the balloon should be `ballooncontroller.local`.

Next, ask an avionics member to add your user to each computer. Choose a password and a short username (these will be your login credentials each time). Enter
`sudo adduser <username>`
Type your first and last name as prompted -- all other prompts can be skipped. Next, enter
`sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>`
After this, proceed to your OS for instructions on connecting.

* ### Windows Users ###
On Windows, there are two options for SSHing into the Pi: PuTTY or the command prompt. PuTTY is generally more compatible with remote shells, so it's the recommended connection method. After launching PuTTY, enter `<username>@<IP>` into the *Host Name* box and click *Open*.
You will be prompted to enter your password; once you do, you will be connected.

* ### MacOS Users ###
In the terminal, enter `ssh <username>@<IP>`. You will be prompted to enter your password; once you do, you will be connected.

### 2. Cloning the Repository and Staying Up-to-Date ###

Orbital uses Git for version control of software. This is achieved by using separate branches for different tasks. The _master_ branch contains the most recent functional version of the repository. Changes can't be made directly to this branch; to make changes, a new branch must be made and edited, followed by a *Pull Request*.

The first time you log in, enter
`git clone https://github.com/purdue-orbital/avionics.git`
This will clone the most recent version of the repository, creating a local version on your profile. Before you do any work, always type `git pull`. This will ensure your version of the _master_ branch is the most up-to-date. Next, type `git branch <name>`, where `<name>` is a descriptive identifier for the task you are working on. Finally, type `git checkout <name>`.

The working branch is now _<name>_ instead of _master_. Once changes are made, to add them to _master_ type `git commit --interactive`. Select only the files you want to change on master, then exit and enter a descriptive message into the `COMMITMSG` file that is opened.

Finally, enter `git push --set-upstream origin <name>` the first time you push to connect your local version to a remote branch (after this is set, you can use `git push`). Enter your Github credentials when prompted: your work should now be on Github!

Go to your branch on Github and click *Make a Pull Request* when you're ready to add your changes to the _master_ branch. Only do this when the new additions have been fully debugged and tested!

Once your task had been completed and committed to the _master_ branch, enter `git checkout master` on the Pi, followed by `git branch -D <name>` to remove the old branch. Lastly, type `git pull` to re-update your version of master and begin the process anew.

## Troubleshooting ##

*  ### Unable to connect to the Pi (can't reach server) ###

   Check that your computer has properly established connection to the network. On Windows, open the command prompt. Enter `ipconfig`, and under the section labelled `Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi` verify that `IPv4 Address` is of the 
   form `192.168.#.XXX`, where `XXX` is any number from 2 to 20. If it isn't, your computer hasn't properly acquired a new local IP. In this case, either reboot your machine or type the following commands:

   `ipconfig /release`

   `ipconfig /flushdns`

   `ipconfig /renew`

   This will refresh your connection settings without requiring a system reboot. Renewing may take a minute or two, so don't be alarmed if it appears to be stall on `Windows IP Configuration`. Afterwards, verify that your IP is now 
   correctly configured by repeating the steps above.

### Please report any further problems to appropriate person(s). ###

Balloon Flight Computer
=======================

Below you will find a simple explanation of this system and its subsequent processes.

### Components ###
   1. Raspberry Pi 3B+: Flight computer, running Raspbian Lite. Software programmed in Python
   2. MPU9250/MS5611: Combined accelerometer/gyroscope, along with a pressure sensor (respectively).
   3. NEO 7M GPS: GPS unit
   4. DS3231 RTC: Millisecond precision for time
   5. Radio: Data transfer to Ground Station via their API through USB Serial
   
## Interaction ##

`src/sensors.py` Collects sensor data and transfers to ground station via Radio and `src/control.py` via Python's multithreading capability

`src/control.py` Makes data-driven decisions for operation of launch platform and rocket

`src/balloon.py` Runs separate threads for `src/sensors.py` and `src/control.py`, as well as passes data between
